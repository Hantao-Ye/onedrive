# How to configure OneDrive Business Shared Folder Sync
Syncing OneDrive Business Shared Folders requires additional configuration for your 'onedrive' client:
1.  List available shared folders to determine which folder you wish to sync & to validate that you have access to that folder
2.  Create a new file called 'business_shared_folders' in your config directory which contains a list of the shared folders you wish to sync
3.  Perform a sync

## Listing available OneDrive Business Shared Folders
List the available OneDrive Business Shared folders with the following command:
```text
onedrive --list-shared-folders
```
   This will return a listing of all OneDrive Business Shared folders which have been shared with you and by whom. This is important for conflict resolution:

## Configuring OneDrive Business Shared Folders
1.  Create a new file called 'business_shared_folders' in your config directory
2.  On each new line, list the OneDrive Business Shared Folder you wish to sync
```text
[alex@centos7full onedrive]$ cat business_shared_folders 
TestSharedFolder
ThisDoesNotExist
SomeRubbishFolder
AnotherSharedFolder
[alex@centos7full onedrive]$ 
```
3.  Validate your configuration with `onedrive --display-config`:
```text
onedrive version                    = v2.3.3-1-gc8e47a4
Config path                         = /home/alex/.config/onedrive
Config file found in config path    = true
Config option 'check_nosync'        = false
Config option 'sync_dir'            = /home/alex/OneDrive
Config option 'skip_dir'            = 
Config option 'skip_file'           = ~*|.~*|*.tmp
Config option 'skip_dotfiles'       = false
Config option 'skip_symlinks'       = false
Config option 'monitor_interval'    = 45
Config option 'min_notify_changes'  = 5
Config option 'log_dir'             = /var/log/onedrive/
Selective sync configured           = false
Selective Business Shared Folders configured = true
business_shared_folders contents:
TestSharedFolder
ThisDoesNotExist
SomeRubbishFolder
```

## Known Issues
Shared folders, shared with you from people outside of your 'organisation' are unable to be synced. This is due to the Microsoft Graph API not presenting these folders.

Shared folders that match this scenario, when you view 'Shared' via OneDrive online, will have a 'world' symbol as per below:
